# TH-VCO1

This is a Eurorack Layout for the [Thomas Henry VCO 1](http://www.birthofasynth.com/Thomas_Henry/Pages/VCO-1.html) Oscillator.

I made very minor changes from Thomas' original to make it work on 12v - detailed here: https://muffwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=49671

This layout is for a modern LM13700 OTA replacing the old 3080, with a That 340 chip providing the matched transistor pairs. The only other non-standard components are a [2K 3300ppm Tempco](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/tempco-resistor-anakeohm-1-3300ppm-x3/) as R2, and a Polystyrene 1nf cap as C3.  

It all works very well, fantastic FM, nice looking and sounding sines. I was able to trim it to 4-5 octaves before getting bored. I haven't used multi-turn trimmers, so it might be harder to trim more accurately. On my second build I haven't trimmed anything, and it works beautifully for my needs.
